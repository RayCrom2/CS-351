Are the results what you expected? 
Speculate as to why it looks like CUDA isn't a great solution for this problem.
- They definitely are not what I expected. I did not think that the cpu would even compete with a GPU that
  parallelizes its computations.
- My guess as to why the results were the way they were is that since it is a vector being computed (contiguous memory)
  and since the vector is made of long's, that dividing it into multiple threads yes divides and conquers, but 
  is required to access so many long's (8 byte pieces of memory) that it is constantly needing to reload the cache
  and requires many bus operations. While the cpu processes it linearly, accessing memory in order and updating the
  cacheline less while utilizing it completely (no unnecessary data being skipped over)
